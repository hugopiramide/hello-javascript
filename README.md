# JavaScript Mini Projects & Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects and exercises. These were built both during class sessions and through personal practice to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## 📚 About

The main goal of these mini projects is to:

- Strengthen core JavaScript skills (variables, functions, arrays, objects, etc.)
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Explore basic logic and algorithm challenges
- Build confidence with real coding problems, from simple to intermediate level

## 🛠️ Projects & Exercises

Here are some of the projects included in this repo:

- ✅ [To-Do List](https://github.com/hugopiramide/hello-javascript/tree/main/workToDos) – A simple task manager with add/remove functionality
- ✅ [Speech Detection](https://github.com/hugopiramide/hello-javascript/tree/main/speechDetection) – Web simple voice recognation

> 🔹 Some of these were done as part of classwork, while others were side projects I created to challenge myself.
