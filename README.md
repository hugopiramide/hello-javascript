# Vanilla JavaScript Mini Projects & Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects and exercises. These were built both during class sessions and through personal practice to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## About

The main goal of these mini projects is to:

- Strengthen core JavaScript skills (variables, functions, arrays, objects, etc.)
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Explore basic logic and algorithm challenges
- Build confidence with real coding problems, from simple to intermediate level
